It took me way too long to figure out how to start this hw. Just trying to figure out how to create my .s files was annoying since we 
worked on this server. The ambiguity of these homeworks always annoys me since it takes me awhile to start these hws even though i read the pdfs
once they are uploaded. This homework was more straightforward however. The hardest part other than starting the hw was printf.
